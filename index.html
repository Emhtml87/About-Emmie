    <h3>Facts About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Emmie — a 38-year-old coding newbie with the spirit of an 18-year-old. I thrive on game nights with my family, especially when they involve food from every corner of the globe. I LOVE swimming, if I could live in the water I would. Perhaps I won't have to pay taxes? I love really random things like Nutella on toast, Aldo purses, sassy lipsticks, and pandas. I’m a nature-loving, music-discovering, moon-gazing human who can (and will) stare at the moon for hours — usually through the lens of my Galaxy phone or sometimes my Canon. I have a healthy obsession with butterflies. Lately, the <a href="https://www.cambridgebutterfly.com/the-famous-blue-morpho/" target="_blank">Blue Morpho butterfly</a> has completely captured my attention — that electric shimmer just does something to my soul. I’m not for the faint of heart when it comes to humor; I’m highly sarcastic and it takes a special kind of person not to get offended by the things I find funny. If you get me, you’re special. If not… well, good luck.</p>
